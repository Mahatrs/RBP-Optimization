# Optimization of Robot Base Placement for Prostate Biopsy Planning

This repository contains the implementation supporting the study:

**Optimization of Robot Base Placement for Prostate Biopsy Planning**

The project investigates kinematic optimization strategies for positioning a KUKA LBR iiwa manipulator in a robot-assisted prostate scanning and biopsy planning system.

The repository is structured around two complementary methodologies:

1. Genetic Algorithm (GA) based base placement optimization  
2. Cuboid-based robustness and feasibility heatmap evaluation
